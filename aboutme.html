                        Hello! I am the person who created this website!
                        I am currently a student at Skool of Code and am currently learning how to code!
                        I like to draw, listen to music, watch tv-shows, code, and do a lot more! <br> <br>
                        At first I was thinking about making this website a fanpage about K-Pop but instead 
                        I decided to make this a place where I showcase all of the works and projects I have done!
                        I hope to be able to inspire you to create something or just enjoy looking at all the stuff I have made!
                    </p>
