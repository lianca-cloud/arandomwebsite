                        Listening to music is my favorite thing to do all the time. In the car? Listen to music. Working on school work? Listen to music.
                        Playing a game? Listen to music. Bored? Listen to music. Currently being chased by a criminal? Listen to music. (for legal reasons
                        this is a joke.) My favorite generes of music are K-Pop, Indie, Electric, and much more! I basically like all genres of music
                        except for country and classical. Below are some of my playlists and reccomendations!
